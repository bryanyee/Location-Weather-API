3) cross site scripting is not allowed (can't make a request to forecast.io)

XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://api.forecast.io/forecast/0f8520f4c584450445574a286536215b/34.0211,-118.3965. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://location2.dev' is therefore not allowed access.

Workaround:
-learn about jsonp
